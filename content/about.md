> I am passionate about new technologies, best practices, rigor, and the continuous development of my skills.

My journey as a **fullstack developer** began in **2019**, while I was in my final year of high school and looking for a school to continue my studies. That's when I discovered my passion for web development, and I continued to develop my skills during my studies at [EEMI](https://www.eemi.com/), where I had the opportunity to dive deeper into this world.

I've had the chance to put my skills into practice through various projects and companies. These experiences have allowed me to deepen my knowledge and develop a thorough understanding of the challenges and opportunities in web development.

I am passionate about **continuous learning** and constantly stay on top of the latest trends and technologies in development. My goal is to create innovative, high-quality web applications that meet users' needs and expectations, while being scalable and maintainable, following development best practices.
