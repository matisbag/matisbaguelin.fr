> Less code, fewer bugs.

I got into web development in **2019** through OpenClassrooms tutorials. I was already into computers, but that's when I realized I actually enjoyed building stuff for the web. I then studied at [EEMI](https://www.eemi.com/) and kept going from there.

I'm fullstack but I lean more towards **front-end**, especially with **Vue.js**. Right now I'm working on [Sportik](/projects/sportik) with a friend — a platform to help sports clubs manage their members and activities. It's the kind of project where I get to make all the decisions, and that's pretty fun.

One thing I'm glad about: I learned to code before AI tools became mainstream. The way people learn now feels different, and I think there's value in having figured things out the hard way first.

I care about writing code that's clean and easy to maintain. Nothing fancy, just doing things properly.
