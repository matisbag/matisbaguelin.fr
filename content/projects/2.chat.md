### Project Background
This instant messaging project was developed as part of a front-end course. With my team, we chose to build an instant messaging application, similar to WhatsApp.

### Technologies Used
This application was built with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) for the front-end, and [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/) was used to create the API. The database is managed by [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). For styling and components, we integrated the [NuxtUI](https://ui.nuxt.com/) library which provides really nice components.

### Features
- User registration and login system
- Ability to create and edit conversations
- Real-time message sending and receiving
