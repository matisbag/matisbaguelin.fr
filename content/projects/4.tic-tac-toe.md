### Project Background
This tic-tac-toe game project was initiated during my third year of bachelor's degree. It was proposed by one of my teachers to put our development skills into practice. We started by creating a version in vanilla TypeScript, then we extended the project by developing a version using React.

### Technologies Used
This tic-tac-toe game project was developed in two versions. The [first version](https://github.com/matisbag/tic-tac-toe/tree/vanilla) was built with vanilla TypeScript, limiting ourselves to the basic web languages: HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. For the [second version](https://github.com/matisbag/tic-tac-toe), I used the [React.js](https://react.dev/) library. This approach allowed for easier application state management and implementation of advanced interactive features.

### Features
- Play against another player locally
- Intuitive user interface to place symbols on the grid
- Automatic detection of game end and display of winner or draw
- Ability to start a new game after a game ends
- Game state management to track the score
