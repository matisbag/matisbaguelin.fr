### Project Background
This photo gallery project was initially assigned as homework by a former React professor during my first year of Master's degree. The goal was to put into practice the concepts and skills we had acquired during our training.

### Technologies Used
This application was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the front-end and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for data management and user authentication. I also used [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) for styling and layout, to ensure a functional user interface without spending too much time on design.

### Features
- Account creation or login to access the photo gallery
- View images in a grid layout
- Ability to add images to the gallery
- Click on an image to view it in fullscreen mode
- In fullscreen mode, ability to download or delete the image
