### Project Background
This sports club management project is being developed as a collaborative initiative with a friend, with the goal of simplifying the day-to-day management of sports associations. We identified a strong opportunity in this space and are building a comprehensive application designed to meet the real needs of sports clubs.

### Technologies Used
The application is built with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) on the front end and [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/) on the back end, powered by a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. Styling and UI components are handled using [NuxtUI](https://ui.nuxt.com/).

### Features
- **Admin Dashboard**: Dedicated admin area for managing the entire platform
- **Association Management**: Configuration and management of the association’s core information
- **Sports & Activities**: Management of seasons, sports, and activities
- **Member Management**: Creation, update, and organization of members (adhérents)

### Upcoming Features
- Bulk import of members
- Internal communication system (announcements, notifications)
- Accounting and financial management module
- Shared calendar for events, trainings, and competitions
